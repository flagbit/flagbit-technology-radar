SGDD is important to be very efficient as it provides both a playground and a framework for development, isolated from the implementation of the application. This isolation promotes the abstract design of components and makes them more reusable.

For example, instead of creating a toolbar for a specific view, the toolbar is created as a standalone component that can fit in many places. In the live style guide, all the different scenarios for implementing the toolbar can be documented.
