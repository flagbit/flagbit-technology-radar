*Kubeless* is a [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.html)-native serverless framework that lets you deploy small bits of code (functions) without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. It is designed to be deployed on top of a Kubernetes cluster and take advantage of all the great Kubernetes primitives.  
If you are looking for an open source serverless solution that clones what you can find on:  
- AWS Lambda 
- Azure Functions
- Google Cloud Functions

*Kubeless* is for you!
