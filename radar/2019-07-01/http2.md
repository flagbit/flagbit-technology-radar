The HTTP/2 protocol version improves the speed, efficiency and security of data transmission. HTTP/1.1 uses multiple TCP connections to load different page elements such as JS, CSS and image files. In comparison, http/2 transfers multiple data in parallel over only one connection, which significantly speeds up loading times. The technique used for this is called multiplexing.
