*"ELK"* is the abbreviation for three open source projects:  

- Elasticsearch
- Logstash
- Kibana.  
  
**Elasticsearch** is a search engine and analytics engine.  

**Logstash** is a server-side data processing pipeline that simultaneously ingests data from different sources, converts it, and then sends it to a location such as Elasticsearch.  

**Kibana** enables data visualization through diagrams and tables in Elasticsearch.
