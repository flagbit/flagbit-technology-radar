Angular is an Open-Source Web Application Framework developed at Google and
Open-Source Maintainers from outside of Google. Angular is complete rewrite by
the same team that broght us AngularJS.

Compared to other modern frontend-stacks like vue.js or react, the main
difference is that is an opinionated framework, while the others are **just**
libraries. This is making it way easier for us to scale in larege teams and
develop enterprise-level frontend applications with them.

Angular is a mixture of object-oriented and functional-programming. Means it is
using classes and a very good dependency injection, which is also giving us
the opportunity to do dependency inversion. On the other hand it is using
RxJS heavily, which is a library for regular functional-programming.
