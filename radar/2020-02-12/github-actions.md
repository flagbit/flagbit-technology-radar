GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with
world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make
code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

Kick off workflows with GitHub events like push, issue creation, or a new
release. Combine and configure actions for the services you use, built and
maintained by the community.

Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate
welcoming new users to your open source projectsâ€”there's an action for that.
Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including
version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency
resolution, using your existing GITHUB_TOKEN.
